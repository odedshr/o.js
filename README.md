# 〇.js
A light framework. Because everyone should have one.

## What this is all about?

〇 was written with three things in mind -
* Learning by experience, which I encourage anyone to do
* Having a framework doing exactly what I need, and I know how it's being done
* finally, having a framework's design as I believe it should

I believe in clear separation between code (Javascript), structure (HTML) and style (CSS).
Having this distinction means the code can easily be replaced with having minimum change in the structure and the style, and vice versa.
This means the code shouldn't dictate which tag is being used and all relevant style alternation are via classes that have a "js-" prefix.

## What does it include

* A mustache-like template-engine!
* Quick access to DOM elements that have an ID
* Batch manipulation on queried DOM elements
* AJAX calls
* Event handling and dispatching

## Still unclear?

I hope you find it useful, if you have any questions/feedbacks/comments or requests, please don't hesitate to [email](mailto:odedshr@gmail.com) me.
